	* dlib: Deniz's library.  glib disappoints.  code blows up without
	error when hash and array sizes increase.  unacceptable.  have to
	write my own version.  need hashes and dynamic arrays.  foreach
	macros and error mechanism.  code using dlib should be easy to
	read.  should not rely on gnu extensions, although it would be
	nice to have obstacks, error, malloc debugging etc.  just the c99
	(or c11) standard, cannot do without declarations in code, stdint
	seems useful etc.  no warnings with pedantic.  inspired by sglib,
	define most things as macros.  have documentation in dlib.h, avoid
	dlib.c if you can.
